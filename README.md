Due to rights, I cannot upload the codebase, but these screenshots can hopefully give an idea of this project!

Aster, as I call it, is is an agentic RAG pipeline built for a specific gardening magazine. Magazines in the form of pdf's are processed and embedded for vector and keyword retrieval. In the web UI (see screenshots), information is cited, and citations can be clicked to open a side window to view that exact page in the magazine. Parts of the screenshots, such as the citations, are blacked out for privacy.

The codebase is entirely in Rust.
