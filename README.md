Due to rights, I cannot upload the codebase, but these screenshots can hopefully give a picture of this project!

Aster, as I call it, is is an agentic RAG pipeline built for a specific gardening magazine. Information is cited, and citations can be clicked to open a side window to view that exact page in the magazine. The codebase is entirely in Rust.

Parts of the screenshots, such as the citations, are blacked out for privacy.
